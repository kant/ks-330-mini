# KS-330 Mini

This project aims to provide CAD drawings and material to a faithful reproduction of one of the most iconic computer
cases from the early 1990s, the [MACASE DIAMOND
KS-330](https://web.archive.org/web/19980502082047/http://macase.com/product/personal/ks-330.htm).

Ultimately the goal is to provide a set of suitable 3D Printed models to create a general purpose
miniature sized KS-330 case for a Raspberry Pi,
[MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki) and similar systems which will provide
compatibility with MS-DOS retro games.

Models are reproduction based on measures from an original case. The focus is primarily on visual
details. Areas which are not visible or clearly a result from practicality around the original
injection molds might not be accurately reproduced.

Please report any suggestions or issues using the GitHub issue tracker.
