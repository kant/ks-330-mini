# TCI Mini

A reproduction of one of the most iconic computer cases from the 90s. The name is taken from the
Norwegian computer manufacturer TCI AS as they used this case as their primary for many years.
Project will probably be renamed once we get more information on the real manufacturer of the OEM
case.
