# TCI Mini

A reproduction of one of the most iconic computer cases from the 90s. The name is taken from the
Norwegian computer manufacturer TCI AS as they used this case as their primary for many years.
We are currently in the process of tracking down real manufacturer of the OEM case and will update
name and project description once we have more information.

Models are reproduction based on measures from an original case. The focus is primarily on visual
details. Areas which are not visible or clearly a result from practicality around the original
injection molds might not be accurately reproduced. Please report any issues using the GitHub issue tracker.
